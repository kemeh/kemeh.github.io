                        The OR Society is pleased to award the Stafford Beer award in 2014 to Paul Tallon for his paper entitled "Do you see what I see? The search for consensus among executives' perceptions of IT business value". The Stafford Beer Medal is awarded in recognition of the most outstanding contribution to the philosophy, theory or practice of Information Systems published in the European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS) within the relevant year. Firms rarely collect data on the precise economic or financial impacts of Information technology (IT), and as such perceptions play a key role in assessing IT impacts. To the extent that if executives in the same firm evaluate IT impacts similarly, it can be easier to approve future IT investments or to initiate corrective action for failing IT investments. The study uses distributed sense-making theory to investigate the conditions under which executives will reach a consensus as to the extent and locus of firm and process-level IT impacts in their firm. Using data from surveys of top-level business executives the author shows that consensus is a function of CIO-led sense-giving in the form of IT promotion, CIO leadership, information systems (IS) engagement with end users, and IS-business communications. In so doing, this manuscript delivers a number of significant, new theoretical contributions, as well as many important practical insights. We congratulate Paul on this award.
